# Multidomain Uptime Tester

Purpose: Tests the uptime of an entire txt file of domains, useful for system admins with a lot of domains to ping test.

Usage:

*Since this is in entirely native Python, you don't need any deps*

`python multidomain-uptime-tester.py`

Run the script once, this creates a txt file, and just place your domains in that txt file (separate by line), and re-run.
